chitter
=======

Chitter allows developers to share useful information quickly and informally using a social, micro-blogging approach.

We're starting this project with a single README file and inviting collaborators to define 
the requirements and architecture as well as developing the application.


Project Principles
------------------
When deciding on our list of requirements and our architecture we want to apply the following principles:

+ We're coding for fun!
+ We're learning new, contemporary technologies
+ We're applying good Agile principles like BDD and CI
+ We're making it quick and easy to get ideas into production
+ We're including our ops team from the beginning
