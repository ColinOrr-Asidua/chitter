chitter
=======

Chitter allows developers to share useful information quickly and informally using a social, micro-blogging approach.

We're starting this project with a single README file and inviting collaborators to define 
the requirements and architecture as well as developing the application.


Project Principles
------------------
When deciding on our list of requirements and our architecture we want to apply the following principles:

+ We're coding for fun!
+ We're learning new, contemporary technologies
+ We're applying good Agile principles like BDD and CI
+ We're making it quick and easy to get ideas into production
+ We're including our ops team from the beginning


Development Principles
----------------------
When making architecture, design and technology decisions, developers should keep the following principles in mind:

+ Chitter will be developed using responsive web design techniques
+ Chitter will be developed using suitable JavaScript and CSS frameworks
+ Chitter will be developed in a manner that does not tie it to one specific database type
+ Chitter will be developed in line with modern web architectural patterns
+ Chitter will be developed in a manner that will support the addition of mobile clients in the future
+ Chitter will be developed using Behaviour Driven Development (BDD)
+ Chitter will be developed using Continuous Integration, Delivery & Deployment
+ Chitter will be developed in a manner that will support public cloud deployment
+ Chitter will be developed using freely available tools and frameworks (no Asidua licenses will be required)
+ Chitter will be developed using tools and frameworks that are not tied to a single platform (e.g. Windows)


Contributing Code
-----------------

Chitter follows the [Fork & Pull](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) model 
for collaborative development.
